Your challenge is to build out a dashboard page and display the market cap of cryptocurrencies in graphical form that are returned from an API. You may use any resources you wish to complete this challenge with the following technologies required to be used:
+	HTML
+	CSS
+	Vanilla JS / jQuery
+	CoinStats API
+	Chart.js to build the graph

A user should be able to:
+	On load, view a bar chart which should contain at least 2 bars of data.
+	Input how many different cryptocurrencies they can view up to a maximum value of 10.
+	There should be some form of refresh functionality built in, automated or user led is up to you.

Style Guide:
+	All fonts should be - Roboto Condensed by Google Fonts.
+	Any icons e.g., refresh icon, to come from Material Icons.
+	The bar chart should be central to the page.
+	You have free reign for styling apart from this.

To find the CoinStats API travel here - https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis and go to the Cryptocurrency section. Once there you will need the route that returns a coin list with global average prices order with market cap.
